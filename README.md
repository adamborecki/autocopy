# autocopy
Mac command line utility to copy multiple volumes (SD cards, SSDs etc.) to multiple destinations (Hard drive, backup drive).

`2 destinations`
`(follow up questions)`
`and..... GO!`
Then:
In finder, there are multiple copies of all data from all sources to different destinations.

# History
This script was created by Adam Borecki, recording.LA, to automate & improve the process of copying data from lots of SD cards to two large capacity HDD hard drives for live concert recordings of classical music, music videos, and other creative audio/video activity.

# Installation
1. Consider doing it manually instead to save time, also consider if this tech is too out of date (google search: is it bad to install php on my computer ?)
2. Install PHP on your system (via homebrew, then "brew install php" or something like that, but google search it first to be safe!)
3. Learn how to update your .bash_profile (or whatever the new equivalent with zsch is) so that you can just type in "autocopy" when you open up the Terminal



# Usage
Follow the prompts given on screen
